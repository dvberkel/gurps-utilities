GURPS Utilities
===============

I am playing [Steve Jacksons][1] General Universal Role Playing
System, abbreviated to [GURPS][2], for a long time now. Recently I got
the oppertunity to become a Game Master again. This repository holds
some useful utilities for a GM.

Utilities
---------

* [hex-paper][3] is an indespable tool for a GM. It serves as a blank
  canvas to orchestrate epic fights. Hex-paper is a easily
  customizable [PostScript][4] file that generates a hexagonal grid.
* [map-maker][5] allows a GM to create realistic maps. The GM defines
  a few control points that outline the area and a fractal
  interpolation generates rough edges.
